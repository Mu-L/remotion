Sometimes, a media file cannot be embedded using [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media)'s [`<Video>`](/docs/media/video) and [`<Audio>`](/docs/media/audio) tags.  
In such cases, a fallback to [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) or [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) from the `remotion` package is attempted.

## When a fallback is attempted

Here are some cases where [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) may fall back to [`<OffthreadVideo>`](/docs/offthreadvideo) or [`<Audio>`](/docs/audio) from `remotion`:

- The resource fails to load due to [CORS restrictions](/docs/cors-issues)
- The container format is not supported by [Mediabunny](/docs/mediabunny/formats)
- The codec cannot be decoded by WebCodecs (e.g. a H.265 stream during rendering)

## Observing when a fallback happens

If [`@remotion/media`](/docs/media) falls back to another tag, then a warning message will be logged in the render:

```
Cannot decode /public/video-h265.mp4, falling back to <OffthreadVideo>
```

If you are rendering on an environment where the logs are not immediately visible (e.g. Lambda), observe whether a fallback has happened by visiting the logs (e.g. CloudWatch).
